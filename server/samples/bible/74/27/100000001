\c 27
\q1
\v 1 Many have sinned for a thing indifferent;
\q1 And he that seeks to multiply \add gain \add* will turn his eye away.
\q1
\v 2 A nail will stick fast between the joinings of stones;
\q1 And sin will \f + \fr 27:2 \ft Gr. \fqa rub. \f* thrust itself in between buying and selling.
\q1
\v 3 Unless \add a man \add* hold on diligently in the fear of the Lord,
\q1 His house will soon be overthrown.
\b
\q1
\v 4 In the shaking of a sieve, the refuse remains;
\q1 So the filth of man in his reasoning.
\q1
\v 5 The furnace will prove the potter’s vessels;
\q1 And the trial of a man is in his reasoning.
\q1
\v 6 The fruit of a tree declares the husbandry thereof;
\q1 So is the utterance of the thought of the heart of a man.
\q1
\v 7 Praise no man before \add you hear him \add* reason;
\q1 For this is the trial of men.
\b
\q1
\v 8 If you follow righteousness, you will obtain her,
\q1 And put her on, as a long robe of glory.
\q1
\v 9 Birds will return to their like;
\q1 And truth will return to those who practice her.
\q1
\v 10 The lion lies in wait for prey;
\q1 So does sin for those who work iniquity.
\b
\q1
\v 11 The discourse of a godly man is always wisdom:
\q1 But the foolish man changes as the moon.
\q1
\v 12 Among men void of understanding observe the opportunity;
\q1 But stay continually among the thoughtful.
\q1
\v 13 The discourse of fools is an offence;
\q1 And their laughter is in the wantonness of sin.
\q1
\v 14 The talk of a man of many oaths will make the hair stand upright;
\q1 And their strife makes one stop his ears.
\q1
\v 15 The strife of the proud is a shedding of blood;
\q1 And their reviling of each other is a grievous thing to hear.
\b
\q1
\v 16 He that reveals secrets destroys credit,
\q1 And will not find a friend to his mind.
\q1
\v 17 Love a friend, and keep faith with him:
\q1 But if you reveal his secrets,
\q1 You shall not pursue after him;
\q1
\v 18 For as a man has destroyed his enemy,
\q1 So have you destroyed the friendship of your neighbor.
\q1
\v 19 And as a bird which you have released out of your hand,
\q1 So have you let your neighbor go, and you will not catch him again:
\q1
\v 20 Pursue him not, for he is gone far away,
\q1 And has escaped as a gazelle out of the snare.
\q1
\v 21 For a wound may be bound up, and after reviling there may be a reconcilement;
\q1 But he that reveals secrets has lost hope.
\b
\q1
\v 22 One that winks with the eye contrives evil things;
\q1 And no man will remove him from it.
\q1
\v 23 When you are present, he will speak sweetly,
\q1 And will admire your words;
\q1 But afterward he will writhe his mouth,
\q1 And set a trap \add for you \add* in your words.
\q1
\v 24 I have hated many things, but nothing like him;
\q1 And the Lord will hate him.
\b
\q1
\v 25 One that casts a stone on high casts it on his own head;
\q1 And a deceitful stroke will open wounds.
\q1
\v 26 He that digs a pit will fall into it;
\q1 And he that sets a snare will be taken therein.
\q1
\v 27 He that does evil things, they will roll upon him,
\q1 And he will not know whence they have come to him.
\q1
\v 28 Mockery and reproach are from the arrogant;
\q1 And vengeance, as a lion, will lie in wait for him.
\q1
\v 29 They that rejoice at the fall of the godly will be taken in a snare;
\q1 And anguish will consume them before they die.
\b
\q1
\v 30 Wrath and anger, these also are abominations;
\q1 And a sinful man will possess them.
