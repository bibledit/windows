\c 19
\q1
\v 1 A workman that is a drunkard will not become rich:
\q1 He that despises small things will fall by little and little.
\q1
\v 2 Wine and women will make men of understanding to fall away:
\q1 And he that joins with prostitutes will be the more reckless.
\q1
\v 3 Moths and worms will have him to heritage;
\q1 And a reckless soul will be taken away.
\b
\q1
\v 4 He that is hasty to trust is light-minded;
\q1 And he that sins will offend against his own soul.
\q1
\v 5 He that makes merry in his heart will be condemned: \f + \fr 19:5 \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f*
\q1
\v 6 \f + \fr 19:6 \ft The preceding part of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f* And he that hates talk has the less wickedness.
\q1
\v 7 Never repeat what is told you,
\q1 And you will fare never the worse.
\q1
\v 8 Whether it be of friend or foe, tell it not;
\q1 And unless it is a sin to you, reveal it not.
\q1
\v 9 For he has heard you, and observed you,
\q1 And when the time comes he will hate you.
\q1
\v 10 Have you heard a word? let it die with you:
\q1 Be of good courage, it will not burst you.
\q1
\v 11 A fool will travail in pain with a word,
\q1 As a woman in labor with a child.
\q1
\v 12 As an arrow that sticks in the \f + \fr 19:12 \ft Gr. \fqa thigh of flesh. \f* flesh of the thigh,
\q1 So is a word in a fool’s belly.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Reprove a friend; it may be he did it not:
\q1 And if he did something, that he may do it no more.
\q1
\v 14 Reprove your neighbor; it may be he said it not:
\q1 And if he has said it, that he may not say it again.
\q1
\v 15 Reprove a friend; for many times there is slander:
\q1 And trust not every word.
\q1
\v 16 There is one that slips, and not from the heart:
\q1 And who is he that has not sinned with his tongue?
\q1
\v 17 Reprove your neighbor before you threaten him;
\q1 And give place to the law of the Most High.
\v 18-19 \f + \fr 19:18-19 \ft Verses 18 and 19 are omitted by the best authorities. \f*
\b
\q1
\v 20 All wisdom is the fear of the Lord;
\q1 And in all wisdom is the doing of the law.
\v 21 \f + \fr 19:21 \ft The remainder of verse 20, and verse 21, are omitted by the best authorities. \f*
\q1
\v 22 And the knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom;
\q1 And the prudence of sinners is not counsel.
\q1
\v 23 There is a wickedness, and it is abomination;
\q1 And there is a fool lacking in wisdom.
\q1
\v 24 Better is one that has small understanding, and fears,
\q1 Than one that has much prudence, and transgresses the law.
\q1
\v 25 There is an exquisite subtlety, and it is unjust;
\q1 And there is one that perverts favor \f + \fr 19:25 \ft Gr. \fqa to bring to light. \f* to gain a judgement. \f + \fr 19:25 \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f*
\q1
\v 26 There is one that does wickedly, that hangs down his head with mourning;
\q1 But inwardly he is full of deceit,
\q1
\v 27 Bowing down his face, and making as if he were deaf of one ear:
\q1 Where he is not known, he will be beforehand with you.
\q1
\v 28 And if for lack of power he be hindered from sinning,
\q1 If he find opportunity, he will do mischief.
\q1
\v 29 A man will be known by his look,
\q1 And one that has understanding will be known by his face, when you meet him.
\q1
\v 30 A man’s attire, and \f + \fr 19:30 \ft Gr. \fqa laughter of the teeth. \f* grinning laughter,
\q1 And gait, show what he is.
