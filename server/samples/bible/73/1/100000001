\q1
\v 1 Love righteousness, all you who are judges of the earth.
\q2 Think of the Lord \f + \fr 1:1 \ft Gr. \fqa in goodness. \f* with a good mind.
\q1 Seek him in singleness of heart,
\q2
\v 2 because he is found by those who don’t tempt him,
\q2 and is manifested to those who trust him.
\q1
\v 3 For crooked thoughts separate from God.
\q2 His Power convicts when it is tested,
\q2 and exposes the foolish.
\q1
\v 4 Because wisdom will not enter into a soul that devises evil,
\q2 nor dwell in a body that is enslaved by sin.
\q1
\v 5 For a holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit,
\q2 and will depart from thoughts that are without understanding,
\q2 and will be ashamed when unrighteousness has come in.
\q1
\v 6 For \f + \fr 1:6 \ft Some authorities read \fqa the spirit of wisdom is loving to man. \f* wisdom is a spirit who loves man,
\q2 and she will not hold a \f + \fr 1:6 \ft Or, \fqa reviler \f* blasphemer guiltless for his lips;
\q2 because God is witness of his inmost self,
\q2 and is a true overseer of his heart,
\q2 and a hearer of his tongue:
\q1
\v 7 Because the spirit of the Lord has filled \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Gr. \fqa the inhabited earth. \f* the world,
\q2 and that which holds all things together knows what is said.
\q1
\v 8 Therefore no one who utters unrighteous things will be unseen;
\q2 \f + \fr 1:8 \ft Some authorities read \fqa nor indeed. \f* neither will Justice, when it convicts, pass him by.
\q1
\v 9 For in his counsels the ungodly will be searched out,
\q2 and the sound of his words will come to the Lord to bring his lawless deeds to conviction;
\q1
\v 10 because a jealous ear listens to all things,
\q2 and the noise of murmurings is not hidden.
\q1
\v 11 Beware then of unprofitable murmuring,
\q2 and keep your tongue from slander;
\q2 because no secret utterance will go on its way void,
\q2 and a lying mouth destroys a soul.
\q1
\v 12 Don’t court death in the error of your life;
\q2 and don’t draw destruction upon yourselves by the works of your hands,
\q2
\v 13 because God didn’t make death;
\q2 neither does he delight when the living perish.
\q1
\v 14 For he created all things that they might have being.
\q2 \f + \fr 1:14 \ft Or, all \fqa the races \ft of creatures \fqa in the world \f*The generative powers of the world are wholesome,
\q2 and there is no poison of destruction in them,
\q2 nor has Hades \f + \fr 1:14 \ft Or, \fqa a royal house \f* royal dominion upon earth;
\q1
\v 15 For righteousness is immortal,
\q2
\v 16 but ungodly men by their hands and their words summon \f + \fr 1:16 \ft Or, \fqa Hades \ft Gr. \fqa him. \f*death;
\q2 deeming him a friend they \f + \fr 1:16 \ft Or, \fqa were consumed \ft with love of him \f* pined away.
\q1 They made a covenant with him,
\q2 because they are worthy to belong with him.
